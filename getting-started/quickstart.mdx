This quickstart documentation shows you how to quickly start integrating with the Spitch API using \*\*Python \*\*or **JavaScript**

<Tip>
  If Python and JavaScript aren't your vibe, try using the ReST API directly. Go to the [API Reference section](/api-reference/synthesize).
  We're working to add SDKs for more languages.

<Steps>
  <Step title='"Get API Key"' icon='"key"'>
    Go to https://spitch.studio to get your API Key. More info on API keys can be found on the [Keys](/concepts/keys) page.
  </Step>
  <Step title='"Install the Python library"' icon='"terminal"'>
    ```
    pip install spitch
    ```

    More info on installation can be found on [Installation](/getting-started/installation)

  <Step title='"Sample Code (Python)"' icon="terminal">
    ```python
    import os
    from spitch import Spitch
    
    os.environ["SPITCH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    client = Spitch()
    
    with open("audio.wav", "wb") as f:
        response = client.speech.generate(
            text="Báwo ni olólùfé?",
            language="yo",
            voice="femi"
        )
        f.write(response.read())
    ```
