This quickstart documentation shows you how to quickly start integrating with the Spitch API using <b>Python</b>.

<Tip>
  If Python isn't your vibe, try using the ReST API directly. Go to the [API Reference section](/api-reference/synthesize).
  We're working to add SDKs for more languages.

    os.environ["SPITCH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    client = Spitch()

    with open("audio.wav", "wb") as f:
        response = client.speech.generate(
            text="Báwo ni olólùfé?",
            language="yo",
            voice="femi"
        )
        f.write(response.read())
    ```
