You're welcome to the Spitch Developer platform. This documentation will walk you through how to integrate and use our language models effectively.

## <Icon icon={"clipboard-question"}/> What is Spitch?

Spitch is a suite of language solutions built with a focus on Africa. Our models are highly capable and solve language problems including transcription, translations, diacritics, and speech synthesis. Our focus is on African languages, and we're excited to be bringing this to you. Whether you're looking to translate between languages, transcribe speech, or handle tone marking, our models are capable of handling these tasks.

Our team does extensive research to bring you the very best models for African languages.

We encourage you to explore the documentation and see how Spitch can meet your language processing needs. Each section is designed to guide you through specific tasks, with examples and code snippets to help you along the way.

We would also love for you to join our growing community of developers on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pJWneuGu). There you can find other developers just like you who are building amazing things with the Spitch API.

Spitch is a product of Babs Technologies, and we're excited to bring you, with API access to our models.
