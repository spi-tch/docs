Crafting strong prompts is the fastest way to unlock natural-sounding speech with Spitch. The guidance below highlights what to include (and avoid) so the model hits the right voice, tone, and pronunciation every time.

## 1. Start with intent + audience

Open your prompt with a short description that gives the listener context, then supply the exact script you want spoken. Spitch voices read the text verbatim—avoid meta-instructions like “speak slowly” or “sound excited,” and instead encode those cues directly into the words and punctuation.

```text
Bedtime story for kids in Lagos.
Once upon a time in Ikorodu... it was the quietest night the twins had ever heard.
```

## 2. Select the right voice for the use case

All voices are production-ready, but each carries its own timbre, pacing, and energy. Match the voice to the job rather than using a single default everywhere.

*Tip:* audition two or three voices for each new product surface, then lock the one that resonates most with your users. You can preview every voice on the [Voices catalog](/concepts/voices) and play sample audio directly in your browser.

## 3. Sprinkle in human disfluencies (sparingly)

Short hesitations such as “uh”, “um”, “hmm”, or “ah” can make generated speech feel conversational. Use them intentionally:

- Add them only where a real speaker would pause (e.g., thinking, switching topics).
- Combine with ellipses `...` to signal a brief pause.
- Avoid stacking multiple disfluencies together; clarity drops quickly.

Example:

```text
Um… I can get that report over to you by 4 PM, no problem.
```

## 4. Clarify acronyms and abbreviations

Spell acronyms in uppercase and add spaces between letters so the model pronounces each character instead of guessing a word.

```text
We’ll begin the briefing with the G R E overview, followed by NASA’s update.
```

You can mix both approaches for long names—keep the acronym spaced out on first mention, then revert to the standard form later in the script.

## 5. Keep scripts clean and well-punctuated

- Use complete sentences and commas where a human would naturally pause.
- Provide numbers in the format you want spoken (`10,000` vs `ten thousand`).
- Remove screen directions the listener should not hear, or wrap them in brackets and clarify they are stage guidance.

## 6. Iterate quickly

Small prompt edits yield noticeable differences. When prototyping:

1. Draft a prompt with intent, script, and any delivery cues.
2. Generate audio in Studio or via SDK.
3. Log what you changed and the result (tone, expressiveness, clarity).
4. Reuse high-performing patterns across similar experiences.
