<Tip>
    If Python isn't your vibe, try using the ReST API directly. Go to the API Reference section.
    We're working to add SDKs for more languages.
</Tip>

## About API Keys
- This is how you are identified on the Spith platform.
- This is a Bearer token usually passed in the `Authorization` header of your request.
- Every request that you send to the Spitch API mush be accompanied by your API key.
- You can only have one valid API key at a time. We will improve key support soon.
- Once you lose your API key, you have to generate a new one by refreshing on your dashboard.

<Warning>
    Ensure you store your API keys properly. Once you refresh the dashboard page, you will not be able to see it in full.
</Warning>

## Getting your API Key

To get your API key, go to https://dev.spi-tch.com. After logging in, an API key is automatically generated for you.
To get a new key, click the refresh button next to your API key and confirm.
<Note>
    Refreshing your API key invalidates the previous one.
</Note>

## How to Use API Keys
Set the Authorization header appropriately.
Find examples below.

<Note>
    For the Python SDK, you only have to set the SPITCH_API_KEY as an environment variable.
    `os.environ["SPITCH_API_KEY"] = "my_api_key"`
