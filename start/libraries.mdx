Learn how to set up a local development environment on your system to use Spitch API. We currently support:
- Python
- TypeScript

## Accessing your API Key
Log on to the [developer portal](https://spitch.studio) to create your API Key. You can store your API Key in a .env file, or use it directly in your code.

```bash .env
SPITCH_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Installation
<CodeGroup dropdown>
```python Python
pip install spitch
```

```javascript JavaScript
npm install spitch
```
</CodeGroup>

## Usage
Test your installation by running the sample code below for text translation.

<CodeGroup dropdown>
```python Python
from spitch import Spitch

client = Spitch(api_key="YOUR-API-KEY")
translation = client.text.translate(
    text="Hey my dear friend, how are you doing?",
    source="en",
    target="ha",
)
print(translation.text)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import Spitch from 'spitch';

const client = new Spitch({ apiKey: process.env.SPITCH_API_KEY });

async function translate() {
  const response = await client.text.translate({
    text: "Hello, how are you?",
    source: "en",
    target: "yo"
  });
  console.log("Translated:", response.text);
}

translate();
```
</CodeGroup>
