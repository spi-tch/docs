description: Here are the Spitch libraries to get started with our SDKs
---

Learn how to set up a local development environment on your system to use Spitch API. We currently support:
- **Python** - Both synchronous and asynchronous clients
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** - Modern async/await support

## Accessing your API Key
Log on to the [developer portal](https://spitch.studio) to create your API Key. You can store your API Key in a .env file, or use it directly in your code.

```bash .env
SPITCH_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Installation
<CodeGroup dropdown>
```python Python
pip install spitch
```

```typescript TypeScript
npm install spitch
```
</CodeGroup>

## Client Setup

The Spitch SDK provides both synchronous and asynchronous clients for Python, and async support for TypeScript:

<CodeGroup dropdown>

```python Python (Async - Recommended)
from spitch import AsyncSpitch

# Using environment variable (recommended)
client = AsyncSpitch()  # automatically reads SPITCH_API_KEY

# Or pass API key directly
client = AsyncSpitch(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

```python Python (Sync)
from spitch import Spitch

# Using environment variable (recommended)
client = Spitch()  # automatically reads SPITCH_API_KEY

# Or pass API key directly
client = Spitch(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY") 
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Spitch } from "spitch";

const client = new Spitch({ 
  apiKey: process.env.SPITCH_API_KEY 
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage Example
Test your installation by running the sample code below for text translation.

<CodeGroup dropdown>
```python Python
from spitch import AsyncSpitch
import asyncio

async def translate_text():
    client = AsyncSpitch()
    translation = await client.text.translate(
        text="Hey my dear friend, how are you doing?",
        source="en",
        target="ha",
    )
    print(translation.text)

# Run the example
asyncio.run(translate_text())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import Spitch from 'spitch';

const client = new Spitch({ apiKey: process.env.SPITCH_API_KEY });

async function translate(): Promise<void> {
    const response = await client.text.translate({
        text: "Hello, how are you?",
        source: "en" as const,
        target: "yo" as const
    });
    console.log("Translated:", response.text);
}

translate();
```
</CodeGroup>
