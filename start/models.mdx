# Mansa.v1

Mansa is a 1.4B parameter ASR model optimized for African languages, offering high transcription accuracy and low-latency performance.

Some of the key features are:

- African named entity recognition in English contexts
- Custom spelling guidance for names and specialized terms.
- Sentence or Word-level timestamps for audio up to 30 minutes (25MB)
