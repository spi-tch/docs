Mansa is a 1.4B parameter ASR model optimized for African names and concepts, offering high transcription accuracy and low-latency performance.

Some of the key features are:

- African named entity recognition in English contexts
- Custom spelling guidance for names and specialized terms.
- Sentence or Word-level timestamps for audio up to 30 minutes (25MB)

<Warning>
Mansa currently supports <b>English</b> only. If you try to use it with any other language, the API will return a 400 error.
