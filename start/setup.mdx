## Getting Your API Key

Before you can use the Spitch API, you'll need to get your API key:

1. Sign up or log in to [Spitch Studio](https://spitch.studio)
2. Navigate to the API Keys section
3. Generate a new API key
4. Store it securely in your environment variables

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure! Never commit it directly to version control or share it publicly.
</Warning>

## Environment Setup

<CodeGroup dropdown>

```bash Environment Variable (Recommended)
export SPITCH_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

```.env add to your .env file
SPITCH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

```powershell Windows PowerShell
$env:SPITCH_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Client Initialization

<CodeGroup dropdown>

```python Python (Async)
from spitch import AsyncSpitch

# Using environment variable (recommended)
client = AsyncSpitch()  # automatically reads SPITCH_API_KEY

# Or pass directly
client = AsyncSpitch(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

```python Python (Sync)
from spitch import Spitch

# Using environment variable (recommended)
client = Spitch()  # automatically reads SPITCH_API_KEY

# Or pass directly
client = Spitch(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY") 
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Spitch } from "spitch";

const client = new Spitch({ 
  apiKey: process.env.SPITCH_API_KEY 
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Verifying Your Setup

Test your API key by making a simple request:

<CodeGroup dropdown>

```python Python
from spitch import AsyncSpitch

async def test_connection():
    client = AsyncSpitch()
    
    try:
        # Test with a simple TTS request
        response = await client.speech.generate(
            text="Hello, this is a test",
            language="en",
            voice="lina"
        )
        print("✅ API key is working!")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error: {e}")
        return False

# Run the test
import asyncio
asyncio.run(test_connection())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Spitch } from "spitch";

const client = new Spitch({ apiKey: process.env.SPITCH_API_KEY });

async function testConnection() {
  try {
    const response = await client.speech.generate({
      text: "Hello, this is a test",
      language: "en" as const,
      voice: "lina" as const
    });
    console.log("✅ API key is working!");
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("❌ Error:", error);
    return false;
  }
}

testConnection();
```

</CodeGroup>

## Next Steps
