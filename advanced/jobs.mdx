The Jobs API is useful for listing and getting jobs.
Certain actions with the Spitch ecosystem take some time to get a response. These are called long-running tasks (or Jobs).
When you perform a long-running task, you don't get a response immediately. You get a Job (with an ID) which you can then use to fetch your task status later.

## Job Behavior

- Jobs represent the output of long-running operations, such as [HITL reviews](./hitl).
- Jobs are read-only; you cannot delete them. You can list all jobs or fetch the details of a specific job.

## Client Setup

<CodeGroup dropdown>
    ```python Python focus={4-6}
    from spitch import Spitch
    client = Spitch()
    jobs = client.jobs.list()
    for job in jobs.items:
        print(job.status)
    ```

    ```typescript Typescript focus={4-6}
    import { Spitch } from "spitch";
    const client = new Sp

    ```
</CodeGroup>
