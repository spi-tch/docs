title: "HITL"
description: "Route critical transcripts to expert reviewers without leaving the Spitch pipeline."

When accuracy is non‑negotiable, you can keep humans in the loop for the riskiest segments while the rest of the job runs fully automated. Human reviewers can verify, correct, or escalate transcripts directly inside Spitch so every SLA is hit without building a bespoke review stack.

## Why teams turn this on

- **Operational peace of mind** – escalate sensitive calls (healthcare, compliance, legal, multilingual) to a verified reviewer with one API flag.
- **Cost control** – only pay for the minutes that require human verification while the bulk of the workload stays fully automated.
- **Brand-safe transcripts** – reviewers apply custom style guides, redaction rules, or glossaries before the transcript ever lands in downstream systems.

## Requesting HITL via API

- Set `model: "human"` when creating a request to route the task to HITL reviewers.
- HITL currently supports STT and translation tasks; we are partnering to expand coverage to additional task types.
- Every HITL request creates a job ID, which you can use later to poll for review status or retrieve the final result.

## Ready to pilot?

- Start a manual review from the **Jobs → Human Review** tab in Studio.
- Flip the `model` switch in your transcription API call.
- Or email [hello@spitch.app](mailto:hello@spitch.app) to scope custom coverage, languages, and SLAs.

Once you turn it on, reviewers become an extension of your transcription pipeline—delivering the quality of a bespoke review team with the simplicity of a single API.
