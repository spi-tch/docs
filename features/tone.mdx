Also known as diacritics, tone marking allows you to add appropriate. This allows the reader (e.g. our text-to-speech AI model, or a human) to know exactly how to pronounce the words properly.
We have built this endpoint with model support for African languages.

<Tip>
    If Python isn't your vibe, try using the ReST API directly. Go to the API Reference section.
    We're working to add SDKs for more languages.
</Tip>

## Request
The `tone_mark()` function can be used to add tone marks to a sentence. Examples are provided below as a guide for you.

## Response
The response for speech generation is in bytes.
* The Content-Type is `application/json`
* A `request_id` is returned for issue resolution with our support team.

Below is an example of a response from the API
```json
{
  "request_id": "'86095cea-77d5-45ba-a093-0f800ac2c7df'",
  "text": "Báwo ni olólùfẹ́ mi?"
}
```

Each of these characters has unique attributes, we think you will find them fun to use. Feel free to try them out and let us know which one you love the most. 😉

## Language Support
The speech generation model supports the following languages:
- Yoruba: yo

Support for Igbo is coming soon.
More info on API keys can be found on the [Languages](/concepts/languages) page

<Note>
    When tone marking a sentence, you should use the language code (e.g. `yo`, `ig`) and not the full text.
</Note>

## Examples - Synchronous
<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    from spitch import Spitch

    client = Spitch()
    response = client.text.tone_mark(
        language="yo",
        text="Bawo ni ololufe mi?"
    )
    print(response)
    ```
</CodeGroup>


## Examples - Asynchronous
<CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    from spitch import AsyncSpitch

    client = AsyncSpitch()
    response = await client.text.tone_mark(
        language="yo",
        text="Bawo ni ololufe mi?"
    )
    ```
