Also known as text-to-speech (TTS), speech generation/synthesis is integral part to modern AI systems. We have built this endpoint with strong support for African languages.

<Tip>
  If Python isn't your vibe, try using the ReST API directly. Go to the [API Reference section](https://docs.spi-tch.com/api-reference/synthesize).
  We're working to add SDKs for more languages.
</Tip>

## Request

The `generate()` function can be used to generate speech. Examples are provided below as a guide for you.

<Info>
  We highly recommend that you perform tone-marking first before TTS. This allows the model to pronounce the words properly during speech generation.
</Info>

## Response

The response for speech generation is in bytes.

* The Content-Type is `audio/wav`

* The content is streamed back to the caller.

* The file type of the generated audio is `wav`.
  If you use the streaming interface (Python SDK), you can start to take action on the byte chunks, e.g. stream to file.

## Choosing a Voice

We currently have 8 characters with unique voices for the supported languages.
Each of these characters has unique attributes, we think you will find them fun to use. Feel free to try them out and let us know which one you love the most. ðŸ˜‰

<Note>
  Not all voices work for all languages. Ensure you select the voice that matches the language of your choice.

  More info on voices can be found on the [Voices](/concepts/voices) page
</Note>

## Language Support

The speech generation model supports the following languages:

* English: `en`

* Hausa: `ha`

* Igbo: `ig`

* Yoruba: `yo`

<Note>
  When generating speech, you should use the language code (e.g. `en`, `yo`, `ig`) and not the full text.

  More info on languages can be found on the [Languages](/concepts/languages) page

## Examples

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Python
  import os
  from spitch import Spitch

  os.environ["SPITCH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
  client = Spitch()

  with open("new.mp3", "wb") as f:
      response = client.speech.generate(
          text="Bawo ni ololufe mi?",
          language="yo",
          voice="sade"
      )
      f.write(response.read())
  ```

  ```python Python (async)
  import os
  from spitch import AsyncSpitch

  os.environ["SPITCH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
  client = AsyncSpitch()

  with open("new.wav", "wb") as f:
      response = await client.speech.generate(
          text="Bawo ni ololufe?",
          language="yo",
          voice="sade",
      )
      f.write(await response.read())
  ```

## Examples - streaming

  ```python Python
  import os
  from spitch import Spitch

  os.environ["SPITCH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
  client = Spitch()

  with client.speech.with_streaming_response.generate(
      text="Bawo ni ololufe mi?",
      language="yo",
      voice="funmi"
  ) as response:
      response.stream_to_file("new.wav")
  ```

  ```python Python (async)
  import os
  from spitch import AsyncSpitch

  os.environ["SPITCH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
  client = AsyncSpitch()

  async with client.speech.with_streaming_response.generate(
      text="Bawo ni ololufe mi?",
      language="yo",
      voice="segun"
  ) as response:
      await response.stream_to_file("new.wav")
