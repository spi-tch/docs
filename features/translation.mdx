Machine Translation converts text from one language to another. This is useful for any context that requires two languages.

<Tip>
  If Python and JavaScript aren't your vibe, try using the ReST API directly. Go to the [API Reference section](/api-reference/translate).
  We're working to add SDKs for more languages.

## Request

The `translate()` function can be used to transcribe audio. Pass a `text`, `source` and `target` languages.
Examples are provided below as a guide for you.

## Language Support

Our speech-to-text model supports the following languages:

- Hausa: ha
- Igbo: ig
- Yoruba: yo
- English: en

More info on languages can be found on the [Languages](/concepts/languages) page

<Warning>
  For many languages, translation is context-based. As such, Spitch may not always get the translation correct.

```python Python
from spitch import Spitch

client = Spitch()
translation = client.text.translate(
    text="Hey my dear friend, how are you doing?",
    source="en",
    target="ha",
)
print(translation.text)
```


```python Python (async)
from spitch import AsyncSpitch

client = AsyncSpitch()
translation = await client.text.translate(
    text="Hey my dear friend, how are you doing?",
    source="en",
    target="ha",
)
print(translation.text)
```


```JavaScript JavaScript
import Spitch from 'spitch';

const client = new Spitch({ apiKey: process.env.SPITCH_API_KEY });

async function translate() {
  const response = await client.text.translate({
    text: "Hello, how are you?",
    source: "en",
    target: "yo"
  });
  console.log("Translated:", response.text);
}

translate();
