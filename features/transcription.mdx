title: "Transcription"
---

Also known as speech-to-text (STT), transcription is the process of converting speech to text. We have built this endpoint with strong support for African languages.

<Tip>
  If Python and JavaScript aren't your vibe, try using the ReST API directly. Go to the [API Reference section](/api-reference/transcribe).
  We're working to add SDKs for more languages.
</Tip>

## Request

The `transcribe()` function can be used to transcribe audio. Pass either a `url` or a `content` to the transcribe function.
Examples are provided below as a guide for you.

<Tip>
  If you provide the `url`, we will download the file from the specified location.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  - You can provide either the `content` (file) or `url` (str), but do not provide both.
  - The maximum file size is 25MB, we will support larger sizes in the future.
  - We only support `mp3`, `wav`, `m4a`, and `ogg` file formats.
  - If you provide `url`, ensure that access to the file is not blocked by authentication.
</Warning>

## Response

The response for speech generation is in bytes.

- The Content-Type is `application/json`
- A `request_id` is returned for issue resolution with our support team.

Below is an example of a response from the transcription endpoint.

```json
    {
      "request_id": "86095cea-77d5-45ba-a093-0f800ac2c7df",
      "text": "Báwo ni olólùfẹ́ mi?"
    }
```

## Language Support

Our speech-to-text model supports the following languages:

- Hausa: `ha`
- Igbo: `ig`
- Yoruba: `yo`
- Amharic: `am`
- English: `en`

More info on languages can be found on the [Languages](/concepts/languages) page

<Note>
  When transcribing, you should use the language code (e.g. `en`, `yo`, `ig`) and not the full text.
</Note>

## Examples - file

```python Python
import os
from spitch import Spitch

os.environ["SPITCH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
client = Spitch()

with open("new.wav", "rb") as f:
    response = client.speech.transcribe(
        language="yo",
        content=f.read()
    )
print(f"Text: {response.text}")
```


```python Python (async)
import os
from spitch import AsyncSpitch

os.environ["SPITCH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
client = AsyncSpitch()

with open("speech.wav", "rb") as f:
    response = await client.speech.transcribe(
        language="yo",
        content=f.read(),
    )
print(f"Text: {response.text}")
```


```JavaScript
import Spitch, { toFile } from 'spitch';
import fs from 'fs';

const client = new Spitch({ apiKey: process.env.SPITCH_API_KEY });

async function transcribeFile() {
  const buffer = fs.readFileSync("hello.wav");
  const file = await toFile(buffer, "hello.wav");

  const res = await client.speech.transcribe({
    content: file,
    language: "en"
  });

  console.log("Transcript:", res.text);
}

transcribeFile();
```
