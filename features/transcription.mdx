Also known as speech-to-text (STT), transcription is the process of converting speech to text. We have built this endpoint with strong support for African languages.

## Request

The `transcribe()` function can be used to transcribe audio. Pass either a `url` or a `content` to the transcribe function.

### Parameters

- `language` (required) - Language code: `en`, `yo`, `ha`, `ig`, `am`
- `content` (optional) - Audio file content (binary data)
- `url` (optional) - URL to the audio file
- `model` (optional) - STT model to use: `mansa_v1`, `legacy`, `human`. Defaults to `legacy`
- `special_words` (optional) - Custom words to help with recognition accuracy
- `timestamp` (optional) - Timestamp granularity: `sentence`, `word`, `none`. Defaults to `none`

<Note>
You must provide either `content` or `url`, but not both.
</Note>

### STT Models

The `model` parameter allows you to choose different speech-to-text models:

- `legacy` (default) - Standard transcription model
- `mansa_v1` - Enhanced model with better accuracy for African languages accent (English only)
- `human` - High-quality model optimized for human speech patterns

### Timestamp Options

The `timestamp` parameter controls the level of timing information returned:

- `none` (default) - No timestamp information
- `sentence` - Timestamps for each sentence
- `word` - Timestamps for each individual word
<Note>
Timestamps are only supported by `Mansa`
</Note>

Examples are provided below as a guide for you.

### Best Practices for Use

<Info>
  - You can provide either the `content` (file) or `url` (str), but do not provide both.
  - The maximum file size is 25MB, we will support larger sizes in the future.
  - We only support `mp3`, `wav`, `m4a`, and `ogg` file formats.
  - If you provide `url`, ensure that access to the file is not blocked by authentication.
  - When transcribing, you should use the language code (e.g. `en`, `yo`, `ig`) and not the full text.

## Response

The response for speech generation is in bytes.

- The Content-Type is `application/json`
- A `request_id` is returned for issue resolution with our support team.

Below is an example of a response from the transcription endpoint.

```json
    {
      "request_id": "86095cea-77d5-45ba-a093-0f800ac2c7df",
      "text": "Báwo ni olólùfẹ́ mi?"
    }
```

## Language Support

Our speech-to-text model supports the following languages:

- Hausa: `ha`
- Igbo: `ig`
- Yoruba: `yo`
- Amharic: `am`
- English: `en`

More info on languages can be found on the [Languages](/concepts/languages) page

```python Python

os.environ["SPITCH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
client = Spitch()

with open("new.wav", "rb") as f:
    response = client.speech.transcribe(
        language="en",
        content=f.read(),
        model="mansa_v1",
        timestamp="sentence"
    )
print(f"Text: {response.text}")
```


```typescript TypeScript

const client = new Spitch({ apiKey: process.env.SPITCH_API_KEY });

async function transcribeFile(): Promise<void> {
    const buffer = fs.readFileSync("hello.wav");
    const file = await toFile(buffer, "hello.wav");

    const res = await client.speech.transcribe({
        content: file,
        language: "en" as const,
        model: "mansa_v1" as const,
