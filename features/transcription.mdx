Also known as speech-to-text (STT), transcription is the process of converting speech to text. We have built this endpoint with strong support for African languages.

<Tip>
    If Python isn't your vibe, try using the ReST API directly. Go to the API Reference section.
    We're working to add SDKs for more languages.
</Tip>

## Request
The `transcribe()` function can be used to transcribe audio. Pass either a `url` or a `content` to the transcribe function.
Examples are provided below as a guide for you.

<Tip>
    If you provide the `url`, we will download the file from the specified location.
</Tip>

<Warning>
    - You can provide either the `content` (file) or `url` (str), but do not provide both.
    - The maximum file size is 25MB, we will support larger sizes in the future.
    - We only support `wav` and `mp3` file formats.
    - If you provide `url`, ensure that access to the file is not blocked by authentication.
</Warning>

## Response
The response for speech generation is in bytes.
* The Content-Type is `application/json`
* A `request_id` is returned for issue resolution with our support team.

Below is an example of a response from the API
```json
{
  "request_id": "'86095cea-77d5-45ba-a093-0f800ac2c7df'",
  "text": "B√°wo ni ol√≥l√πf·∫πÃÅ mi?"
}
```

If you use the streaming interface (Python SDK), you can start to take action on the byte chunks, e.g. stream to file.

Each of these characters has unique attributes, we think you will find them fun to use. Feel free to try them out and let us know which one you love the most. üòâ

## Language Support
Our speech-to-text model supports the following languages:
- Yoruba: yo
- English: en

Support for Hausa and Igbo are coming soon.
More info on languages can be found on the [Languages](/concepts/languages) page

<Note>
    When transcribing, you should use the language code (e.g. `en`, `yo`, `ig`) and not the full text.

    ```python Python
    from spitch import Spitch

    os.environ["SPITCH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    client = Spitch()

    with open("new.wav", "rb") as f:
        response = client.speech.transcribe(
            language="yo",
            content=f.read()
        )
        print(response)
    ```

    ```python Python (async)
    from spitch import AsyncSpitch

    os.environ["SPITCH_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    client = AsyncSpitch()

    with open("speech.wav", "rb") as f:
        response = await client.speech.transcribe(
            language="yo",
            content=f.read()
        )
        print(response)
